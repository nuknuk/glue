glue
====

Enabling unobtrusive binding for UI widgets in Javascript.

What does Glue solve?

* You want to use some UI widgets in an MVVM way (like Kendo UI)
* The libraries you have require some code to run and create or bind widgets to the DOM
* You don't want to do that in the HTML because.. well.. it's just not done that way.


glue
----
1. Keeps JavaScript out of your DOM and HTML.
2. Keeps bootstrapping out of your clean models.
3. Keeps binding logic in one controllable place.


**How Do I?**

- Include glue.js
- Call glue once when you feel your DOM is ready
